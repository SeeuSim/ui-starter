# UI Starter

This monorepo contains a starter UI component library I can use to bootstrap full stack, micro-service based Typescript applications.

Any apps will go inside the `/apps` workspace, and import:

- UI components from the `@repo/design-system` package.
- Configuration files from the various `@repo` packages within `packages/`.
